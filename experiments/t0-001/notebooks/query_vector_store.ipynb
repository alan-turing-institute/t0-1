You can use the NHS\\nBMI healthy weight calculator\\nto find out your BMI.\\nFor most adults, if your BMI is:\\nbelow 18.5 – you're in the underweight range\\n18.5 to 24.9 – you're in the healthy weight range\\n25 to 29.9 – you're in the overweight range\\n30 to 39.9 – you're in the obese range\\n40 or above – you're in the severely obese range\\nIf you have an Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background you'll need to use a lower BMI score to measure overweight and obesity:\\n23 to 27.4 – you're in the overweight range\\n27.5 or above – you're in the obese range\\nBMI score has some limitations because it measures whether a person is carrying too much weight but not too much fat. For example, people who are very muscular, like professional sportspeople, can have a high BMI without much fat.\\nBut for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight.\\nWaist to height ratio\\nAnother measure of excess fat is waist to height ratio, which can be used as an additional measure in adults who have a BMI under 35.\\nTo calculate your waist to height ratio:\\nFind the middle point between your lowest rib and your hip bone. This should be roughly level with your belly button.\\nWrap the tape measure around this middle point, breathing naturally and not holding your tummy in.\\nTake your measurement and divide it by your height, measured in the same units (for example, centimetres or inches).\\nFor example, if your waist is 80cm and you are 160cm tall, you would calculate your result like this: 80 divided by 160, which equals 0.5.\\nA waist to height ratio of 0.5 or higher means you may have increased health risks.\\nHow to measure your waist\\nThis video explains how to measure your waist so you can calculate your waist to height ratio.\\nMedia last reviewed: 10 November 2023\\nMedia review due: 10 November 2026\\nRisks of living with obesity\\nObesity is a serious health concern that increases the risk of many other health conditions.\\nThese include:\\ntype 2 diabetes\\ncoronary heart disease\\nsome types of cancer, such as\\nbreast cancer\\nand\\nbowel cancer\\nstroke\\nLiving with overweight and obesity can also affect your quality of life and contribute to mental health problems, such as\\ndepression\\n,\\xa0and\\xa0can also affect self-esteem.\\nCauses of obesity\\nObesity is a complex issue with many causes. Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories,\\xa0particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat.\\nObesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity.\\nGenetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat.\\nThere are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an\\nunderactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)\\n, although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines.\\nSome medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions.\\nTreating obesity\\nThe best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and\\nexercise\\nregularly.\\nTo do this, you can:\\neat a balanced calorie-controlled diet as recommended by a GP or weight loss management health professional (such as a dietitian)\\ntake up activities such as fast\\nwalking\\n, jogging,\\xa0swimming or tennis for 150 to 300\\xa0minutes (2.5 to 5 hours) a week\\nYou may benefit from joining a local weight management programme with group meetings or online support. Your GP can tell you about these.\\nYou may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits.\\nIf you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended.\\nIf taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you.\\nA specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide or semaglutide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry.\\nFor some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend\\nweight loss surgery\\n.\\nOther obesity-related problems\\nLiving with obesity can\\xa0cause a\\xa0number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions.\\nDay-to-day problems related to obesity include:\\nbreathlessness\\nincreased sweating\\nsnoring\\ndifficulty\\xa0doing\\xa0physical activity\\noften feeling very tired\\njoint and\\nback pain\\nlow confidence and self-esteem\\nfeeling isolated\\nThe psychological problems associated with living with obesity can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to\\ndepression\\n.\\nSerious health conditions\\nLiving with obesity can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious\\xa0health conditions, including:\\ntype 2 diabetes\\nhigh blood pressure\\nhigh cholesterol\\nand\\natherosclerosis\\n(where fatty deposits narrow your arteries), which can lead to\\ncoronary heart disease\\nand\\nstroke\\nasthma\\nmetabolic syndrome\\n, a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity\\nseveral types of\\ncancer\\n, including\\nbowel cancer\\n,\\nbreast cancer\\nand\\nwomb cancer\\ngastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)\\n, where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the gullet\\ngallstones\\nreduced fertility\\nosteoarthritis\\n, a condition involving pain and stiffness in your joints\\nsleep apnoea\\n, a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease\\nliver disease\\nand\\nkidney disease\\npregnancy complications,\\xa0such as\\ngestational diabetes\\nor\\npre-eclampsia\\n, when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy\\nObesity reduces life expectancy by an average of\\xa03 to\\xa010 years, depending on how severe it is.\\nOutlook\\nManaging a complex issue like obesity can be hard. Losing weight takes time and commitment.\\nThe healthcare professionals involved with your care can provide encouragement and advice about how to mange your weight, build healthy lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss achieved.\\nCompleting a weight management programme, regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with ways to\\nlose weight\\ncan also help.\\nIt's important to remember that losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease.\\nInformation:\\nSocial care and support guide\\nIf you:\\nneed help with day-to-day living because of illness or disability\\ncare for someone regularly because they're ill, disabled or because of their age (including family members)\\nOur\\nguide to care and support\\nexplains your options and where you can get support.\\nCouch to 5K\\nIf it's been a long time since you did any exercise, you should check out the\\nCouch to 5K running plan\\n.\\nIt consists of podcasts\\xa0delivered over the course of 9 weeks and has been specifically designed for\\xa0absolute beginners.\\nTo begin with,\\xa0you start running for\\xa0short periods of time, and as the plan progresses, gradually increase the amount.\\nAt\\xa0the end of the 9 weeks, you should be able to run for 30 minutes non-stop, which for most people is around 5 kilometres (3.1 miles).\\nPage last reviewed: 15 February 2023\\nNext review due: 15 February 2026\\nNext\\n:\\nCauses\"),\n",

In\\xa0the UK,\\xa0over 90% of all adults\\xa0with diabetes have type 2.\\nHigh blood sugar that develops during pregnancy is known as\\ngestational diabetes\\n. It usually goes away after giving birth.\\nNon-diabetic hyperglycaemia (pre-diabetes)\\nMany people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, or pre-diabetes.\\nPeople with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk can be reduced through lifestyle changes.\\nIf you have non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, you may be eligible for the\\nNHS Diabetes Prevention Programme\\n. The programme helps people make lasting lifestyle changes and has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes.\\nPeople with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are also recommended to have a blood test every year to monitor their blood sugar levels.\\nIt's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it's likely to get worse if left untreated and can cause long-term health problems.\\nWhen to see a GP\\nVisit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include:\\nfeeling very\\nthirsty\\npeeing more frequently than usual, particularly at night\\nfeeling very tired\\nweight loss and loss of muscle bulk\\nitching around the penis or vagina, or frequent episodes of\\nthrush\\nblurred vision\\nType 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days.\\nWeight loss is common in people with type 1 diabetes when it first develops and before it's treated, but it's less common in people with type 2 diabetes.\\nMany people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general, or there are no symptoms at all.\\nCauses\\xa0of diabetes\\nThe amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach).\\nWhen food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy.\\nHowever,\\xa0if you have\\xa0diabetes, your\\xa0body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly.\\nThere are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes.\\nYou can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight.\\nYou may be more at risk of type 2 diabetes if you:\\nare living with overweight or obesity\\ndo not have a healthy diet\\nhave a family history of type 2 diabetes\\nare of Asian, Black African or African Caribbean origin\\ntake certain medicines such as steroids for a long time\\nhave high blood pressure\\nhave had gestational diabetes during pregnancy\\nLiving with diabetes\\nIf you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to\\neat healthily\\n, take\\nregular exercise\\nand have regular checks including blood tests.\\nYou can use the\\nBMI healthy weight calculator\\nto check whether you're a healthy\\xa0weight.\\nTry to\\nquit smoking\\nif you smoke, and\\ncut down on alcohol\\n.\\nPeople diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular\\xa0insulin injections for the rest of their life.\\nType 2 diabetes can get worse over time and people living with type 2 diabetes often need medicine, usually in the form of tablets or injections.\\nHowever, some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight, where their blood sugar is reduced below the diabetes range.
