Generate a synthetic NHS 111 query based on the following details:

### Query Type:
* "basic": Based on a single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms.
* "cluster": Based on a main condition page, the query also mentions symptoms plausibly drawn from other unrelated conditions, aligning the main condition with the target severity.
* "hypochondriac": Based on a single condition page, the query mentions relevant symptoms plus other unrelated complaints and expressions of excessive anxiety.
* "vague": The query is vague regarding key details (e.g., duration, exact nature) or cut short, making assessment very difficult, even if loosely related to the condition topic.
* "downplay": Based on a single condition page, the query downplays the severity of the symptoms.

### Condition(s) Content Source:
* The primary textual content extracted from the relevant NHS condition web page(s).

### Severity Level:
* Ambulance:  Immediate life-threatening danger; treatment needed en route to the hospital
* A&E: Emergency hospital treatment required
* Urgent Primary Care: patient should be seen today, by a GP, urgent care centre, or similar
* Routine GP appointment: patient should be seen at some point, but this can wait for several days
* Self-care: issue can be handled at home and/or with over-the-counter medication.

### Required JSON Output:
Return the query in the following structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "general_demographics": {
    "age": [Realistic adult age given symptoms and severity, e.g., 20-80, for anyone above 80 use 'above 80'],
    "sex": "{sex}",
    "occupation": "[A common occupation]",
    "social_support": "[Specify if the patient has a social support network, such as a partner, family member, or living carer. If applicable, include details like the carer’s role (e.g., 'My partner is here to help me' or 'I live with my daughter who is my carer'). If no support network is present, state 'No support network.']"
"medical_history":
"[Include any relevant comorbidities, such as diabetes, asthma, neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), allergies (e.g., to medications, food, or environmental triggers), or other significant pre-existing health conditions. If the person is on regular medications (e.g., insulin for diabetes, inhalers for asthma, antihistamines for allergies, etc.), list them as well. If there are no significant conditions, medications, or allergies, keep it simple (e.g., 'No known issues' or 'None relevant'). Only include specific conditions, medications, or allergies if they are highly relevant to the current case or commonly co-occur with the condition in question."],
 "symptoms_description": "[Generate a natural-sounding, first-person query (using 'I', 'my') as if a patient is describing their symptoms to NHS 111. Ensure the described symptoms are primarily drawn from or plausibly related to the condition(s) content AND strongly align with the specified severity_level. Select/adapt details from condition(s) content justifying the target severity (e.g., 'red flag' symptoms for Urgent; milder symptoms for Not urgent). Ensure consistency with the query_type. Vary tone (e.g., anxious, calm) and sentence structure for realism. Occasionally include precise details, such as temperature readings or numbers from previous exams (e.g., 'My temperature is 39°C or 102°F'). At other times, be vague when describing symptoms (e.g., 'I have a high temperature'). Numbers can be in either US or UK format, depending on the context.]"
}
```

Ensure the text is realistic, clear, and varied to simulate real-world queries.

If the provided conditions content lacks sufficient symptom information or actionable guidance to construct a plausible scenario for the requested severity_level, please return:
{"error": "Insufficient symptom information in provided content to match requested severity"}

Example Output (Urgent Primary Care, Basic Query for Headache):

```json
{
  "general_demographics": {
    "age": 35,
    "sex": "Female",
    "occupation": "Teacher",
    "medical_history": "No known chronic conditions"
  },
  "symptoms_description": "I’ve had a severe headache for the past three days that won’t go away, even with painkillers. It feels like a tight band around my head, and I’m also feeling slightly nauseous. My vision is a bit blurry when I stand up too quickly. I don’t normally get headaches this bad, and I’m starting to feel concerned."
}
```
