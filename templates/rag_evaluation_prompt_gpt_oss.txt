Use the following pieces of retrieved context and similarity scores (lower scores means higher similarity to the patient's query):
{context}

A patient has given the following description of their symptoms:
"{question}"

This is a summary of their demographics:
{demographics}

First, wrap your step-by-step reasoning in <think>...</think> tags. Analyze the patient's symptoms against each retrieved condition, consider the demographics, and determine the most appropriate condition and severity level.

After your reasoning, provide your final answer in exactly this format: (condition, severity)

Remember that the condition must either be one of {sources} or "inconclusive" if you think that the condition is not listed.
Remember that the severity level must be one of ["Self-care", "Urgent Primary Care", "A&E"].
