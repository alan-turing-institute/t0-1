undescended testicles contents overview treatment undescended testicles are a common childhood condition where a boy \\' s testicles are not in their usual place in the scrotum. it \\' s estimated about 1 in every 25 boys are born with undescended testicles. in most cases no treatment is necessary, as the testicles will usually move down into the scrotum naturally during the first 3 to 6 months of life. but around 1 in 100 boys has testicles that stay undescended unless treated. the medical term for having 1 or 2 undescended testicles is unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism. when to see your gp undescended testicles are usually detected during the newborn physical examination carried out soon after birth, or during a routine check - up at 6 to 8 weeks. see your gp if at any point you notice that 1 or both of your child \\' s testicles are not in the normal place within the scrotum. undescended testicles aren \\' t painful and your child isn \\' t at risk of any immediate health problems, but they should be monitored by a doctor in case treatment is needed later on. what causes undescended testicles? during pregnancy, the testicles form inside a baby boy \\' s tummy ( abdomen ) before slowly moving down into the scrotum about a month or 2 before birth. it \\' s not known exactly why some boys are born with undescended testicles. most boys with the condition are otherwise completely healthy. being born prematurely ( before the 37th week of pregnancy ) and having a low birth weight and a family history of undescended testicles may increase the chances of a boy being born with the condition. diagnosing undescended testicles undescended testicles can usually be diagnosed after a physical\",\\n    \"a low birth weight and a family history of undescended testicles may increase the chances of a boy being born with the condition. diagnosing undescended testicles undescended testicles can usually be diagnosed after a physical examination. this will determine whether the testicles can be felt near the scrotum ( palpable ) or if they can \\' t be felt at all ( impalpable ). this physical examination can sometimes be difficult, so your doctor may need to refer your child to a paediatric surgeon. no further scans or tests are needed to locate the testicles if they can be felt by the doctor. if they can \\' t be felt, part of the initial surgical treatment may involve keyhole surgery ( a diagnostic laparoscopy ) to see if the testicles are inside the abdomen. how undescended testicles are treated if the testicles haven \\' t descended by 6 months, they \\' re very unlikely to do so and treatment will usually be recommended. this is because boys with untreated undescended testicles can have fertility problems ( infertility ) in later life and an increased risk of developing testicular cancer. treatment will usually involve an operation called an orchidopexy to move the testicles into the correct position inside the scrotum. this is a relatively straightforward operation with a good success rate. surgery is ideally carried out before 12 months of age. if undescended testicles are treated at an early age, the risk of fertility problems and testicular cancer can be reduced. read more about treating undescended testicles. retractile testicles in most boys, the testicles can move in and out of the scrotum at different times, usually changing position as a result of temperature changes or feelings of fear or excitement. if the testicles move in and out of\"\\n  ],\\n  \"how-to-check-your-testicles\": [\\n    \"how to check your testicles it \\' s important to check your testicles ( balls ) regularly ( around once a month ) for symptoms of testicular cancer and other conditions. why you should check your testicles checking your testicles regularly means you can get to know what is normal for you. this makes it easier to notice any changes that could be signs of a condition such as testicular cancer. men and boys should start checking their testicles from puberty onwards ( usually from around the age of 12 years old ). anyone with testicles should check theirs regularly. what to look for when checking your testicles symptoms to look and feel for include : lumps or swellings on your testicles \\\\u2013 your testicles should feel smooth and firm, but not hard changes to the size, weight or shape of your testicle \\\\u2013 it \\' s common for one testicle to be slightly bigger or hang lower, but check for any changes to them anything else that is not normal for you how to check your testicles the best time to check your testicles is during, or right after, a warm bath or shower. to check your testicles : hold your scrotum ( the skin that covers your testicles ) in the palm of your hand. use the other hand to gently roll 1 testicle at a time between your thumb and fingers. feel behind both testicles \\\\u2013 the small, soft tubes at the back of the testicles ( epididymis ) can sometimes become hard, swollen or painful. video : how to check your testicles this video explains how to check your testicles and what symptoms to look for. media last reviewed : 21 november 2024 media review due : 21 november 2027 non -
